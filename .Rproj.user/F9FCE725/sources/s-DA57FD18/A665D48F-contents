## Functions

### CoFA
`CoFA` is a function to implement the whole estimation and prediction for both common and independent factors. 

#### Usage
```{R}
set.seed(1234)
## 1. Read in real data
real_data <- read_real_data(select_ear = "right")

data_ready <- real_data$data_ready

y_sample <- data_ready[, which(names(data_ready) == "WBXA001") : which(names(data_ready) == "WBXA107") ]
y_sample <- as.matrix(y_sample)
z_sample <- data_ready[, -c(1:323, dim(data_ready)[2]-1,  dim(data_ready)[2]) ]
z_sample <- as.matrix(z_sample)

t_frequencies <- data_ready[1, which(names(data_ready) == "WBXF001") : which(names(data_ready) == "WBXF107") ]
t_temp  <- log( as.numeric(t_frequencies) )
t_vec <- ( t_temp / (t_temp[length(t_temp)] - t_temp[1]) ) -  ( t_temp / (t_temp[length(t_temp)] - t_temp[1]) )[1]

## 2. Apply CoFA method
CoFA_fit <- CoFA(y_sample = y_sample, z_sample = z_sample, y_center = TRUE, z_standard = TRUE, 
                 t_vec = t_vec, num_knot = 37)
```

#### Argument
**y_sample:**  The functional data matrix.

**z_sample:**  The multivariate data matrix.

**t_vec:**  The vector of the observation points of functional data.

**y_center:**  A logical value to indicate whether y_sample needs to be centered (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

**z_standard:**  A logical value to indicate whether z_sample needs to be standardized (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

**num_knot:**  An integer to specify the total numbers of knots.

**user_K1:**  An integer for the number of independent factors in functional data, \(K_{1}\), fixed by users. If not specified (NULL), estimation by BEMA method applies. In case that the estimate of \(K_{0}\) is greater than or equal to that of \(K_{0}+K_{1}\), the value of \(K_{1}\) is set to \(3\). 

**user_K2:**  An integer for the number of independent factors in multivariate data, \(K_{2}\), fixed by users. If not specified (NULL), estimation by BEMA method applies. In case that the estimate of \(K_{0}\) is greater than or equal to that of \(K_{0}+K_{2}\), the value of \(K_{2}\) is set to \(3\). 

**gamma:**  The parameter used for weights in adaptive nuclear norm penalty. Default is 2. 

**BEMA_alpha:**  One of the two tuning parameters in the BEMA method. It determines a percentage of nonzero eigenvalue in the middle range. Default is 0.2

**control:**  A list of options for cross validation (CV) to choose an optimal tunning parameter \(\tau\). There are 3 arguments: **num_fold**, **num_tau** and **num_rep**. First, **num_fold** determines the number of folds in CV.  **num_fold** specifies the number of candidates for \(\tau\), which are equally spaced in log scale ranging from 0 to \(\sigma^{\gamma+1}_{1}(\mathbf{\Gamma})\). **num_rep** indicates the number of repetition of CV with resampling folds. The chosen \(\tau\) at each iteration are recorded and their average value is used as the final choice. 


#### Value

**K1:**  The estimated (or specified by user) number of independent factors in functional data. In case that the estimate of \(K_{0}\) is greater than or equal to that of \(K_{0}+K_{1}\), the value of \(K_{1}\) is set to \(3\).

### CoFA_CrossCov
`CoFA_CrossCov` finds a matrix \(\mathbf{M}\) and its decomposition that minimizes \(\|\mathbf{\Gamma}-\mathbf{M}\|^{2}_{F}+\tau\|\mathbf{M}\|_{\star,\mathbf{w}}\). A small dataset generated in simuloation study is used to demonstrate how this function works. 
fitting the coefficient matrix $B$ in the `mSIM` algorithm. We use a small dataset within the package to demonstrate the the usage of this function.

t_vec_example <- seq(from=0, to=1, by= 1/49)
CoFA_CrossCov_fit = CoFA_CrossCov(Y_cent=Y_example_data, Z_cent=Z_example_data, t_vec = t_vec_example,  
                                  B_tilde=B_tilde_example, gamma=2, 
                                  control = list(num_fold=5, num_tau=50, num_rep=10) )

### simulation_study
`simulation_study` is used to conduct simulation study with the setting in the reference. There are 3 scenarios with different sample sizes \(n=100,200,500\). It will save the output RData file in the current working directory. For more information, please see the comments and explanation in the R file. Since the control argument of `CoFA_CrossCov` function within this function is set up with intensive CV(both **num_tau** and **num_rep** are 100), it will take a lot of time if **N** is large. 


#### Usage
```{r}
simulation_result <- simulation_study(snr=5, sample_size=200, N=1, num_resampling_CV=10)

## To reproduce the results in simulation study
# simulation_result <- simulation_study(snr=5, sample_size=c(100,200,500), N=1000, num_resampling_CV=100)
# simulation_result <- simulation_study(snr=5, sample_size=c(100,200,500), N=1000, num_resampling_CV=100)
```

##### Argument
**snr:**  The signal noise level.

**sample_size:** A numeric vector of sample sizes.

**N:** The number of iteration for each scenario.

**num_resampling_CV:** The number of repetitions for CoFA function

#### Value
**results_final:**  The list that contains the simulation study results. It will be also saved in the current working directory. 


### read_real_data
`read_real_data` is used to read in the data files publically available in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data storage. The output will ba a single data matrix with the wideband absorbance (WBA) functionaland scalar variables. For more information, please see the reference and comments in the R file.


#### Usage
```{r}
data_list <- read_real_data(select_ear = "right")
```

**select_ear:**  A character variable to choose either "right" ear WBA data or "left" ear WBA data. 


#### Value
**res:**  The list that contains three data matrix: the data matrix of chosen ear, the tympanometry label matrix, and tympanometric function data matrix. 


### data_application
`data_application` is used to conduct the common factor analysis for the real data of NHANES. The output will ba saved in the current working directory as .rda file. For more information, please see the comments in the R file.


#### Usage
```{r}
result_list <- data_application(which_ear = "right", num_knot = 20)
```

##### Argument
**which_ear:**  A character variable to choose either "right" ear WBA data or "left" ear WBA data. 

**num_knot:**  A single or sequence of positive integers specifying the total number of knots used in the analysis. By default, cubic spline basis is chosen so that 8 of the knots will be out of 0 and 1.  

**num_resampling_CV:** The number of repetitions for CoFA function


#### Value
**res:**  The list that contains the estimation results and the standardized multivariate data matrix which will be used for `gam_application` and `logistic_application`. It will be also saved as .rda file in the current working directory. 


### gam_application
`gam_application` is used to fit the generalized additive models with different combination of predicted random components. In order to run this function, `real_data_application` must be run beforehand in the same working directory since `gam_application` needs the prediction results. The output will ba saved in the current working directory as .rda file. For more information, please see the comments in the R file.


#### Usage
```{r}
gam_result <- gam_application(which_ear = "right", model_num = 9)

## To reproduce the results in data application
# read_data <- read_real_data( select_ear = "right")
